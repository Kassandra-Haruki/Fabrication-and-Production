# Fabrication-and-Production
A plugin for Endless Sky that adds Ammo Fabricators and other fun production things!

Hate paying for ammo? Don't want to rely on the Syndicate's shipping network? Want to enter every fight armed to the teeth? Say no more! Kass. Inc presents...

# Ammo Fabricator!

Install these glorious masterworks on any ship in your fleet and they'll automatically restock your flagship every day, for free!

Now that the advertisements are over, here are the current limitations of the plugin:
- It cannot restock any other ship aside from you flagship, due to code limitations.
- It cannot give you ammo without opening a conversation, because it cannot give you a number of ammo equal to a variable (currently relying on a hacky trick called "branchlooping")
- The Ammo Fabricator doesn't have its own image.

If you have any inquiries or complaints, contact our customer service department and we will do our best to assist you! Kass. Inc wishes you safe travels!
